# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
* Timely delivery is crucial in software project management to avoid delays that will end leading to extra costs. Project managers can use tools like trello, jira and asana.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
* The project will end within the specified timefrime with no extra costs. Whenever there are extra features added kindly say NO, and when there are delays re-adjust the schedule and prioritize what is important.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
* Agile methodology: more flexible, focuses on small, rapic cycle(called sprints). Lightweight documentation, focused on working software.
* Waterfall methodology: linear flow, one step finishes before the next starts. Heavyweight documentation, required before development starts.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
* 
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Use tools like:
*  trello: organise tasks visually with boards and cards.
*  jira: great for tracking sprints and tasks.
*  asana: hlep teams coordinate work.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
* 
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
* Clearly defining the problem will help in coming up with a software solution, explaining how the product solves the problem easily and effectively.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
* Keep it simple, short, fun and easy to understand by starting with an intriguing question or using powerful stats. Explain the concept in a way that is compelling, exciting and clear.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
* Keeping it short: 3-5 minutes(MAX).
* Make it fun: add stories, examples and humor.
* Being visual: use slides with minimal text, fun images and GIFs.
* Being confident:even if you are nervous, act like a pro.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
* 
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
* Understanding market trends will help you know your audience, which partners to attract and where to get funding.
